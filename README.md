Explanation to ohe csv files:
When you see columns with **0/1** values in your one-hot-encoded (OHE) dataset, each column represents **“Is this observation in a certain category?”** Specifically:

- **1** = “Yes, this row (observation) belongs to that category.”  
- **0** = “No, it does not belong to that category.”

### How It Works

1. **Original Categorical Variables**  
   In your raw data, you had columns like `workclass`, `occupation`, `native_country`, etc. Each of these can take multiple possible values (e.g., “Private,” “Self-emp,” “Local-gov,” etc.).

2. **One-Hot Encoding**  
   For each distinct category (e.g., “Private,” “Self-emp,” “Local-gov”) within a column (like `workclass`), one-hot encoding creates a new column named something like `workclass.Private` or `workclass.Self-emp`.  
   - If the original `workclass` for a particular row was “Private,” then `workclass.Private` = 1 for that row, and all the other `workclass.*` columns = 0.  
   - If `workclass` was “Self-emp,” then `workclass.Self-emp` = 1, etc.

3. **Why 0/1?**  
   Machine learning models often work best with numerical inputs. By turning each category into a 0/1 indicator, algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks can easily handle the information.

### Example

Suppose a row in your original dataset had:
- **workclass** = `"Private"`  
- **occupation** = `"Sales"`  

After one-hot encoding, you might see columns such as:
- `workclass.Private` = **1** (because the row’s workclass is Private)  
- `workclass.Self-emp` = 0 (because it’s not Self-emp)  
- `occupation.Sales` = **1** (because the row’s occupation is Sales)  
- `occupation.Tech-support` = 0 (because it’s not Tech-support)  
- … and so on for every other category in `workclass`, `occupation`, etc.

Hence, **1** indicates that the row matches the category named in that column, and **0** indicates it does not.
